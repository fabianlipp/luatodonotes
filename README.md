# luatodonotes
This package allows you to insert comments for further editing in your document.
The comments are shown in the margins besides the text.
Different styles for the comments can be used, which can be configured using
package options.
This package depends heavily on Lua, so it can only be used with LuaLaTeX.

luatodonotes is based on the todonotes package by Henrik Skov Midtiby
(http://www.ctan.org/pkg/todonotes).
