# luatodonotes
The package allows the user to insert comments into a document that
suggest (for example) further editing that may be needed.

The comments are shown in the margins alongside the text; different styles
for the comments may be used; the styles are selected using package
options.

The package is based on the package todonotes by Henrik Skov Midtiby
(http://www.ctan.org/pkg/todonotes), and depends heavily on Lua,
so it can only be used with LuaLaTeX.
